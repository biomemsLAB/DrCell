# DrCell

## About

DrCell is a MATLAB based tool to analyze electrophysiological data recorded with microelectrode array (MEA) chips.

Supported signals:
- Neural signals
- Cardiac signals

Supported MEA chips:
- Multi channel systems (MCS), 60 electrode MEAs and 6-well electrode MEAs
- 3brain, 4096 electrode MEAs
- Axion, 24 well-plate with 16 electrode MEAs per well.

## Getting Started

1. **Download:**
   - Download the "DrCell" folder to your computer.

2. **Execution:**
   - Execute the main script by dragging and dropping "DrCell.m" into the MATLAB terminal.

3. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**
   - The execution process automatically opens the Graphical User Interface (GUI) for DrCell.

4. **Path Configuration:**
   - The execution process automatically adds all DrCell subfolders to the MATLAB path environment.
